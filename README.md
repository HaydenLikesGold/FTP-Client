# FTP-Client
FTP Python project that follows guidelines from RFC-959.

## Installation
Just ensure that you have python3, clone the repo, and execute python3 client.py

## Usage
Due to required specifications of the project, all server information is placed
within the code. To adjust this simply look for places where the server is listed,
this would include the login information.

## Credit
I worked individually on this project for a lab in my networking course.
